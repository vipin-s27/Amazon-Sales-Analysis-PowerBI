# Amazon Sales Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project provides an analytical overview of Amazon product sales performance.
It tracks Year-to-Date (YTD) and Quarter-to-Date (QTD) metrics to help understand sales trends, top-performing categories, and customer engagement via reviews.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to monitor and analyze Amazon product sales across various KPIs to gain insights into revenue performance, product movement, and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset used

## KPI Requirements
This dashboard includes four main KPIs to track business performance:
- YTD Sales – It shows the total sales made so far in the current year.
- QTD Sales – It shows the total sales made in the current quarter to track short-term trends.
- YTD Products Sold – It represents the total number of products sold throughout the year.
- YTD Reviews – It shows the total number of customer reviews received this year to understand feedback and satisfaction levels.

## Chart Requirements
The dashboard uses different charts to make the data easy to understand and visually clear:
- Sales by Month (Line Chart) – This shows how sales change month by month and helps identify seasonal trends.
- Sales by Week (Column Chart) – This chart displays weekly sales performance and short-term fluctuations.
- Sales by Product Category (Heat Map/Text Chart) – It compares sales across different product categories to highlight top-performing ones.
- Top 5 Products by YTD Sales (Bar Chart) – It shows the top 5 products that generated the highest sales this year.
